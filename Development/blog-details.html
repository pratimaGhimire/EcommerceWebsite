            Technology has an impact on how people communicate, learn, and
            think. It contributes to society and influences how individuals
            interact on a daily basis. In today's world, technology plays a
            critical role. It has both beneficial and negative repercussions on
            the planet, as well as a direct impact on people's lives.Technology
            has changed our lives and has made the world smaller with faster
            communication, instant information access, and online interactions.
            Technological advancements have brought everything to our
            fingertips, making life more enjoyable and convenient.

          <p>
            Small firms might benefit from business technology to improve their
            communication procedures. Emails, messaging, websites, and apps, for
            example, help businesses communicate with customers more effectively
            Companies can saturate the economic market with their message by
            employing a variety of information technology communication tactics.

          <h2 class="title">Impact on Study</h2>
          <p>
            Technology creates a more engaging learning environment. It improves
            collaboration and incorporates different learning styles. It also
            boosts motivation and allows students to self-pace. Students benefit
            from technology because it gives them fast access to knowledge,
            rapid learning, and engaging ways to apply what they've learned. It
            allows students, particularly in STEM, to explore new disciplines
            and get a better comprehension of complex concepts.

          <h2 class="title">Negative Impact</h2>
          <p>
            Eye strain and difficulties focusing on crucial tasks may be caused
            by social media and mobile devices, which can lead to psychological
            and physical problems. They may also play a role in more significant
            health issues including depression. Overuse of technology may have a
            greater impact on children and teenagers who are still developing.
            While the seemingly limitless amount of knowledge available on the
            internet appears to be beneficial to education, it appears that it
            has not made a significant contribution to the cause of education.
            Because knowledge is readily available, there is an overuse of
            technology in the classroom, which plainly has a detrimental impact
            on the learning process. In addition to encouraging plagiarism and
            cheating in the classroom, over use of technology and the Internet
            has harmed analytical and critical thinking skills. This isn't just
            conjecture; studies have demonstrated that higher use of
            entertainment technology like video games and social media is
            associated with lower academic achievement.

          <p>
            Technology is extremely beneficial to today's society, providing
            several new opportunities in a variety of disciplines; nevertheless,
            when the boundaries are crossed and the public loses control of
            these devices, there is a dilemma that can have major ramifications
            for human growth...
